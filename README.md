# Library for icpc-like competitions

This is just a compilation of useful algorithms and data structures on icpc-like competitions.

Some of what you can find here:
  * Segment Tree
  * Tarjan's Algorithm
  * Dinic's Algorithm
  * Graham Scan ( To find the convex hull of a set of points )
  * Andrew's monotone chain convex hull algorithm
  * Trie

List of algorithms and D.S.'s to add:
  * Dijkstra
  * Fenwick Tree
  * Add lazy propagation on the Segment Tree
